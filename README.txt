Code for the WGamma cross section measurement at sqrt(s)=8 TeV with CMS. The muon and electron channles are considered.
Performs event selection, background subtraction, detector resolution unfolding, acceptance and efficiency corrections, and cross section calculation. Also include several side checks and plots, including the full cross section measurement of ZGamma in the muon and electron channels. 
The Wgamma measurement is endorsed by the CMS collaboration to become a PhD thesis.

Technical details on how to run the code are available in WGammaAnalysis/README
